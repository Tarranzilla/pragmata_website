    "description1": "We are a Creative Lab, focused on providing Art & Design services and developing our own Products. We offer two main solutions:",
    "description2": "On one side, we create and sell our own products in our carefully curated store for sustainability and modularity - called the Lighthouse of Inventions.",
    "description3": "We seek a projectual dialogue and a blurring of the boundaries between users and designers that stimulates an alternative, autopoeitic, anthropophagic, symbiotic, and parasitic consumption logic through upcycling, open and free design, and decentralized production.",
    "description4": "We BELIEVE THAT buying a product or service is more than enjoying a good - it is supporting an idea - and supporting an entire production network behind it.",
    "description5": "On the other side, we offer our creativity and innovation services in graphic design, product design, web design, UI UX, services, and consulting - always moving towards sustainability.",
    "description6": "Our design is Critical.",
    "description7": "Through the proposition of questioning and innovative projects, we seek a genuinely new way of designing, modifying material and social reality in positive and inclusive ways so that our community has access to food, tools, services, and dignified work.",
    "description8": "Like the idea? Then join us, let's schedule a conversation and create something MEANINGFUL!"

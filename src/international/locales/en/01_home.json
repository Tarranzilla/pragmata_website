    "description1": "In a tropical haven forgotten by time, where creatures roamed nonchalantly on paradisiacal beaches and jungles, a select group of primates ascendedâ€”and thus emerged, the mysterious people of the Pragmatas.",
    "description2": "These primates evolved into inventors and visionaries of worlds. Understanding the subtle language of nature and the deafening whisper of the cosmos, they made themselves creators of technologies. In this world, they erected not only physical structures but also webs of affections, social systems, and culture.",
    "description3": "On those forgotten beaches, they forged tools to unlock the extraordinary. They nurtured the souls and minds of all those who sought them, desperate and hungry, eager to share in the rarest food in the world: an original idea or a thought that no one had ever had before. They thus engaged hearts and minds in a mysterious shared enchantment.",
    "description4": "It was on a night illuminated by the glow of the stars that they had a transcendental vision: that of all the tribes of the world uniting in an epic collaboration, building something that would transcend common understanding. They would forge a new world, the world of tomorrow.",
    "description5": "To bring together the artisans of this future, they erected a structure, simultaneously a workshop and a lighthouse, for the synthesis of the tools of this work and to attract all minds that shared these aspirations. It was the Lighthouse of Pragmatas Inventions. Known as an epicenter of technological enchantment, it became a sanctuary where nature and innovation intertwined.",
    "description6": "Today, the descendants of the Pragmatas continue the tradition of building not only products and services but also bridges between worlds, uniting communities on a creative and legendary journey where mutual help is the key to truly building something useful.",
    "description7": "We invite you to explore the Lighthouse of Inventions - Discover our universe of innovation and immerse yourself in our products, services, and experiences that weave the past, present, and future into a fascinating cosmoweave.",
    "description8": "Welcome to our world, where the enchantment of technology and the technology of enchantment intertwine, creating a future of sustainable possibilities.",
    "description9": "We are a Creative Lab, focused on providing Art & Design services and developing our own Products. We offer two main solutions:",
    "description10": "On one side, we create and sell our own products in our carefully curated store for sustainability and modularity - called the Lighthouse of Inventions.",
    "description11": "We seek a projectual dialogue and a blurring of the boundaries between users and designers that stimulates an alternative, autopoeitic, anthropophagic, symbiotic, and parasitic consumption logic through upcycling, open and free design, and decentralized production.",
    "description12": "We BELIEVE THAT buying a product or service is more than enjoying a good - it is supporting an idea - and supporting an entire production network behind it.",
    "description13": "On the other side, we offer our creativity and innovation services in graphic design, product design, web design, UI UX, services, and consulting - always moving towards sustainability.",
    "description14": "Our design is Critical.",
    "description15": "Through the proposition of questioning and innovative projects, we seek a genuinely new way of designing, modifying material and social reality in positive and inclusive ways so that our community has access to food, tools, services, and dignified work.",
    "description16": "Like the idea? Then join us, let's schedule a conversation and create something MEANINGFUL!"
